# Yolo sample generator #

### This file is takes a selected ROI from the video frame and uses a TRACKER to follow the object in the ROI, if there is an object. And saves the picture and encodes the YOLO format in some .txt files ###

*Tips. Try CLF TRacker, it works better than MIL TRACKER. And check the way that the labels are calculated, it might be an old version that the calculus isn't working well.

*Download an annotation tool and compare the results.
